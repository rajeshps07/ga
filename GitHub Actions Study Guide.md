### Manage workflow runs
* Configure caching of workflow dependencies
* Identify steps to pass data between jobs in a workflow
* Remove workflow artifacts from GitHub
* Add a workflow status badge
* Add environment protections
* Define a matrix of different job configurations
* Implement workflow approval gates

## Domain 2: Consume workflows (20% of exam)

### Interpret the effects of a workflow
* Identify the event that triggered a workflow from its effects in a repository, issue, or pull request
* Describe a workflow’s effects from reading its configuration file
* Diagnose a failed workflow run (i.e. using a workflow run history and its logs, determine why a workflow run may have failed)
* Identify ways to access the workflow logs from the user interface
* Identify ways to access the workflow logs from GitHub’s REST API
* Enable step debug logging in a workflow
* Demonstrate how to use default environment variables in a workflow
* Demonstrate the correct syntax for passing custom environment variables in a workflow step

### Locate a workflow, its logs, and artifacts
* Describe where to locate a workflow in a repository
* Explain the difference between disabling and deleting of workflows
* Demonstrate how to download workflow artifacts from the user interface
* Describe how to use an organization’s templated workflow

### Use actions in a workflow
* Define the indicators of what makes a trustworthy action
* Identify an action’s type, inputs, and outputs
* Demonstrate how to use the specific version of an action in a workflow

## Domain 3: Author and maintain actions (25% of exam)

### Use available action types
* Identify the type of action required for a given problem (i.e. JavaScript, Docker container, run step)
* Demonstrate how to troubleshoot JavaScript actions
* Demonstrate how to troubleshoot Docker container actions

### Describe the components of an action
* Identify the files and directory structure needed to create an action
* Identify the metadata and syntax needed to create an action
* Implement workflow commands within an action to communicate with the runner (Note: this includes exit codes)

### Distribute an action
* Identify how to select an appropriate distribution model for an action (i.e., public, private, marketplace)
* Identify the best practices for distributing custom actions
* Demonstrate how to create a release strategy for an action (i.e. versioning)
* Demonstrate how to publish an action to the GitHub marketplace

## Domain 4: Manage GitHub Actions in the enterprise (15% of exam)

### Distribute actions and workflows to the enterprise
* Explain reuse templates for actions and workflows
* Define an approach for managing and leveraging reusable components (i.e. repos for storage, naming conventions for files/folders, and plans for ongoing maintenance)
* Define how to distribute actions for an enterprise
* Define how to control access to actions within the enterprise
* Configure organizational use policies for GitHub Actions

### Manage runners for the enterprise
* Describe the effects of configuring IP allow lists on GitHub-hosted and self-hosted runners
* Describe how to select appropriate runners to support workloads (i.e. using a self-hosted versus GitHub-hosted runner, choosing supported operating systems)
* Explain the difference between GitHub-hosted and self-hosted runners
* Configure self-hosted runners for enterprise use (i.e. including proxies, labels, networking)
* Demonstrate how to manage self-hosted runners using groups (i.e. managing access, moving runners into and between groups)
* Demonstrate how to monitor, troubleshoot, and update self-hosted runners

### Manage encrypted secrets in the enterprise
* Identify the scope of encrypted secrets
* Demonstrate how to access encrypted secrets within actions and workflows
* Explain how to manage organization-level encrypted secrets
* Explain how to manage repository-level encrypted secrets
